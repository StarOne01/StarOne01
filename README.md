<h2><u>About me (in my way of storytelling)</u></h2>
Welcome to my cosmic digital realm, where I wield the ethereal languages of C and C++ as the enchanting spells of software magic. I journey to the deepest recesses of machines, sculpting their very souls to resonate with electronic vitality that pulses through the cosmic ether.

Yet, my pursuits reach far beyond the mundane. I am a cosmic explorer of cybersecurity, unveiling hidden truths that span galaxies. From the vast cosmic tapestry of astronomy to the intricate celestial dance of wireless networks, and from the holographic vistas of captivating graphics to the quantum core of bare-metal transistors, I am the cosmic revealer of secrets, peeling back the fabric of reality to reveal the cosmic code beneath.

I am no ordinary engineer; I am a cosmic dual-faceted sorcerer, both Electric and Electronic. Electronic engineering is my conduit to manipulate the cosmic web of Computers and electronical systems, harnessing the energies of milliamps to create powerful, celestial artifacts on sandwiched PCBs. In the realm of Electric engineering, I play with the thunderous forces of thousands of volts, forging high-power cosmic contraptions that defy earthly bounds.

Embark on this cosmic odyssey with me, where science fiction and reality intertwine like cosmic strings. Together, we shall traverse uncharted code, pushing the boundaries of what the cosmos allows, and plunging into the very heart of technology, unlocking the cosmic mysteries of the electronical cosmos.
